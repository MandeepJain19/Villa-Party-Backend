    Description:
      "The newly built Villa Ixfalia takes much of its design inspiration from an unlikely source: the vibrant, soulful continent of Africa. You can see that in the ethereal bird's-nest lamps that hang from the ceilings and the massive shell necklaces on display in a bedroom. It is transporting in the most literal of ways as the owners set out to evoke a sense of voyage to far-off places and discovery of exotic treasures and filled the house with items brought back from their sojourns. The feeling of worldly travel that pervades this luxury rental home marries easily with the natural beauty of St. Barth, and materials such as wood and straw feature prominently in the furniture and finishings.Thanks to its hillside location in the Morne des Diamands above St. Jean, Villa Ixfalia has spectacular views over the Eden Rock hotel and St. Jean Bay, as well as a high level of privacy. The heated swimming pool has an unusual shape that takes the best advantage of those sea views. The garden is filled with exotic plants and trees, and dramatic rock formations rise strikingly in the back. Along with design choices made to maximize those views, the villa also benefits from a layout that makes the most of the cool sea breezes coming off the bay.It is not just the circulating fresh air that makes Villa Ixfalia feel like a comfortable home. There is a Zen vibe about the way it has been designed and laid out. There are plenty of indoor, sunny and shaded outdoor places to relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones, be they family or a group of friends.",

Immaculately presented, with sunny highlights throughout, it has a relaxing vibe. At night the villa takes on a whole, new vibe, with a dramatically lit turquoise pool and soft, well-appointed lightingaround the villa. Great to relax with a drink and enjoy the stars.There are a good selection of local Portuguese restaurants and shops within a short stroll of the villa. Famed for its dramatic rock formations and golden sand, Praia Gale is one of the closest beaches. Nestled against the rocky coves, this pale sand beach has lots of rock pools for the kids to explore and really fun, splashy waves.",
